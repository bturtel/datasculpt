use_case = "We are analyzing Reddit posts from subreddits like r/IVF, r/infertility, and r/IVFAfterSuccess to understand which interventions or protocols have led to improved IVF outcomes. Specifically, we want to find posts where users share their personal IVF attempts, especially cases where previous results were suboptimal and then they implemented a new protocol (only single-word, underscore-separated keywords), supplement, medication, dietary change, or lifestyle practice that led to better outcomes. We want to extract before/after metrics (previous egg/embryo counts vs. new counts), identify conditions, and categorize interventions into four categories: medications, supplements, lifestyle_changes, and diet. All interventions must be a single keyword with underscores (e.g. coq10, dhea, nr, nad, high_protein_diet, keto_diet, acupuncture, meditation). If both baseline and new counts are known, compute percent_change_eggs and percent_change_embryos as ((new - baseline)/baseline)*100. Do NOT invent details. ONLY use what the user explicitly states. If specifics aren't given, leave them out."
